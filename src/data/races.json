Similar to the way heat is transferred from a warm object to a cold one, a gifted aetherborn need only touch another living being with a clawed hand to draw life essence out, fueling their own continued existence while draining strength and vitality from their victim.",
						"For many aetherborn, living as they do for indulgence and instant gratification, the concepts of \"want\" and \"need\" are virtually synonymous. But Aetherborn with this gift understand what it is to truly need, for they develop a hunger for life essence that far exceeds any desires they might have felt before their transformation. A gifted aetherborn who abstains from this feeding deteriorates even more rapidly than other aetherborn, while enduring unspeakable agony caused by the deprivation of life energy.",
						"At the DM's option, an aetherborn character can research methods of achieving this dark \"gift.\" The process is similar to inventing and manufacturing a rare magic item (see \"Inventing and Manufacturing Devices\" earlier in this document). But rather than aether, the process requires a variety of rare unguents and unusual ingredients that make up the cost of researching and undergoing the transformation.",
						"An aetherborn with this gift gains the Drain Life ability: a natural attack that deals {@dice 1d6} necrotic damage and restores the same number of hit points to the aetherborn. However, if the aetherborn goes for 7 days without dealing this damage, their hit point maximum is reduced by {@dice 1d6} per week. This reduction can't be removed until the aetherborn has used their Drain Life ability and completed a long rest."
